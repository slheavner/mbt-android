##### Setup
The project requires a Bus API URL and a Google Maps API Key as string resources
```
  <string name="mbt.url.api">BUS_API_URL</string>
  <string name="google.map.key">API_KEY</string>
```
The project also needs an API to talk to, which is the [mbt-api repository](https://github.com/slheavner/mbt-api)  
Follow the setup instructions there to setup your own API service.

##### About

This project is the Android app for the Morgantown Bus & PRT Tracker project. It was made out of a need to track the buses around Morgantown, WV, as a West Virginia University student. It was also made because *programming is fun*.
